# Survivr2

## Project Overview
The Survivr2 project will combine your knowledge of Ruby's object orientation and automated testing principles in a challenging and rewarding task. You will be creating a simulation of the game Survivor, where contestants participate in challenges to be saved from elimination. You will be presented with a series of files that contain tests and some empty files where your code will go. Your challenge is to ensure all of the tests pass, and that your simulation runs smoothly and matches the game mechanics described in the prep lesson


## Why does this matter?
Learning how to work in a TDD workflow is a very useful skill as a developer. Many of the world's best developers work with TDD and are comfortable using tests to ensure their code works. Automated testing can save you massive headaches in the future and will help you find your bugs much faster. This project will also solidify your knowledge of object orientation and Ruby mechanics in general, since some of the tests are tricky and require knowledge of return values, standard output and object inspection.

## Getting started
Go to the 'tests.rb' file FIRST. This will contain the information required to start running your tests. You will survive!

## Completing this Project
Complete all of the following requirements to finish Survivr2:
* **Tests**: Make all of the tests pass.
* **Simulation**: Ensure the simulation is in line with the game mechanics described in the prep lesson.
* **Colorizr**: Once the tests pass and the simulation is accurate then use your Colorizr gem to add color to the text output to the terminal. You will have to colorize at least the tribe names. You may want to color the tribe names, the contestant names, the winners, or anything else. Get creative with your colorizing. It will surely help visibility.
* **Tips**:
  * Make sure that you are writing just enough code to make the tests pass. Refactor your code once you are happy with the passing test.
